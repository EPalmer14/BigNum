# BigNum
Java BigNum project

This project allows for calculations to be made of numbers that are too large for computers to handle. This is done with binary calculations using a linked list
of nodes. This project constructs a BigNum either from an int or a string. This project can compare two BigNums, as well as add, subtract, and multiply BigNums 
using both positive and negative numbers.
